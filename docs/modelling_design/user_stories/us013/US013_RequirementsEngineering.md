## **US013 - As Manager, I want to define the Scrum Master of a project.**

### **1.1 – User Story Description**

As Manager, I want to define the Scrum Master of a project.

### **1.2 – Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

From the specifications document:
- "The Manager should have the ability to associate resources with projects. This association can be made at the time of project creation or before each sprint".
- "It is a scrum best practice that no resource should be allocated to more than a project at a given time, so that developers are focused on the tasks in hand. But this may not be feasible for specific technical and/or short duration tasks".
- "The system should ensure that at no time (i.e. week) is a resource associated with an allocation of more than 100% in different projects. You should also ensure that a resource is not associated with project activities that go out of the allocation time they have set".

From the client clarifications:
