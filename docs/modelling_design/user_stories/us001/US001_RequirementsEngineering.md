## **US001 - To create user profiles.**

### **1.1 – User Story Description**

As Administrator, I want to create user profiles.

### **1.2 – Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

From the specifications document:
- "Administrator profile is available when the system is installed (an account with this profile should be automatically created with installation)";
- "Configuration of profiles associated with users is available to the administrator, in order to restrict access to features. Each profile will have permissions associated with available actions and functionalities".

From the client clarifications:
* Question: Should the administrator be able to configure other profiles (besides Administrator, Manager and User)?
* Answer: “No, only those three”.

* Question:Is there only one Administrator, or can several users be assigned this profile?
* Answer: “There’s no reason to restrict it to one user. But it’s irrelevant”.
