As Project Manager, I want to create a sprint.

### **1.2 – Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

**From the specifications document:**

- "Each sprint has a “sprint backlog”, i.e., the set of US that should be addressed during the
  sprint. The definition of the sprint backlog is a joint effort of the PO and the team, during the
  sprint planning ceremony."

**From the client clarifications:**

* "Regarding US019, let's assume that all sprints have the same duration as defined in the project."


### **1.3 – Acceptance criteria**

### **1.4 – Found out dependencies**

* There is a dependency to US010. The project must be registered/created so a sprint can be created.
