## **US011 - I want to associate a user as Team Member of a project**

### **1.1 – User Story Description**

As Manager, I want to associate a user as Team Member of a project.

### **1.2 – Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

- **From the specifications document:**
  The Manager should have the ability to associate resources with projects. This association can be made at the time of project creation or before each sprint. It is a scrum best practice that no resource should be allocated to more than a project at a given time, so that developers are focused on the tasks in hand. But this may not be feasible for specific technical and/or short duration tasks.
  When associating a resource with a project, the following information should be specified: “Start date”, “End date”, “Cost per hour (monetary value that the resource costs for each hour used in the project)”, “Percentage of allocation (100% for full-time, or the percentage corresponding to part time)”. 

  The system should ensure that at no time (i.e. week) is a resource associated with an allocation of more than 100% in different projects. You should also ensure that a resource is not associated with project activities that go out of the allocation time they have set.
