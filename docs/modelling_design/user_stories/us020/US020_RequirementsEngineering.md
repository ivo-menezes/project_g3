## **US020 - As Team Member, I want to add a user story in the product backlog to the sprint backlog, during the sprint planning ceremony.**

### **1.1 – User Story Description**

As Team Member, I want to add a user story in the product backlog to the sprint backlog, during the sprint planning ceremony .

### **1.2 – Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

**From the specifications document:**

- "In scrum, the requirements of the project are expressed as user stories and the set of all user
stories (US) is the “project backlog”, i.e., the ordered set (by priority) of all user stories still to
be implemented in the project." (p. 3-4)
- "Each sprint has a “sprint backlog”, i.e., the set of US that should be addressed during the sprint. 
The definition of the sprint backlog is a joint effort of the PO and the team, during the sprint planning ceremony. 
In this ceremony, an effort estimate is defined for each US, only applicable to that specific sprint, so that it is possible 
to estimate the total effort in the sprint." (p. 4) 
- "At the end of the sprint, the unfinished user stories in the sprint backlog and those whose implementation may have been 
rejected by the PO return to the product backlog." (p. 4)
