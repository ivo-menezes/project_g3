## **As Manager, I want to associate a user as Team Member of a project in the web UI.**

### **1.1 – User Story Description**

As Manager, I want to associate a user as Team Member of a project in the web UI.

### **1.2 – Customer Specifications and Clarifications**

**From the specifications document:**

The Manager should have the ability to associate resources with projects. This association can be made at the time of project creation or before each sprint. It is a scrum best practice that no resource should be allocated to more than a project at a given time, so that developers are focused on the tasks in hand. But this may not be feasible for specific technical and/or short duration tasks.
When associating a resource with a project, the following information should be specified: “Start date”, “End date”, “Cost per hour (monetary value that the resource costs for each hour used in the project)”, “Percentage of allocation (100% for full-time, or the percentage corresponding to part time)”.


**From the client clarifications:**

- So far, there is no further information from the client, regarding the User Story in question.

### **1.3 – Acceptance criteria**

- Awaiting further information regarding Acceptance criteria;

### **1.4 – Found out dependencies**
